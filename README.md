# AI-Powered Image Annotation System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **AI-Powered Image Annotation System** is an intelligent annotation tool designed to streamline the image classification process. The system leverages AI to classify images automatically, and when uncertain, it requests manual input from users. This hybrid approach enhances annotation accuracy, making it a valuable tool for dataset creation and model training.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Automatic Image Classification** – Uses AI models to classify images.  
- **Manual Annotation Support** – Allows users to classify images when the model is uncertain.  
- **Efficient Dataset Generation** – Combines AI and human validation to create high-quality datasets.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Designed for seamless interaction.  
- **Scalable Backend** – Built to handle large datasets efficiently.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js (or any framework your team is using)  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express / FastAPI (or the technology your backend team chose)  
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- **AI Model:** TensorFlow / PyTorch-based classification model  
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS, or any cloud service

## 🎯 How It Works  
1. Upload an image to the system.  
2. The AI model attempts to classify the image.  
3. If the model is confident, it provides a classification result.  
4. If the model is uncertain, the user is prompted to provide manual annotation.  
5. The system stores both AI-generated and manually verified labels to improve accuracy.  

## 🔧 Installation  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-annotation.git
cd ai-image-annotation
